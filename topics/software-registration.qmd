## Register Software in PURE

Just like your publications, research sofware that you have developed for your research constitutes research output, too. Therefore you are required to record your research software in PURE.[^1] Your research software can be of interest to others, which can in turn lead to new collaboration opportunities. Research software recorded in PURE also appears in reports that are used for research evaluations. Even if access to your research software is closed, you are required to register your research software in PURE. It is a record of the work that you have carried out.

### Benefits of recording your software in PURE

* It increases the visibility and findability of your research software
* It contributes to re-use and transparency
* It boosts your collaboration opportunities
* It counts towards research evaluations and assessments

[^1]: “Researchers are responsible for ensuring that a description of archived and published data and software is included in the ‘Current Research Information System’ (CRIS) of VU Amsterdam. In most cases, this is done automatically. Researchers should be able to provide information about data and software in an Availability statement.” [Responsibility number 8 from the Research Data and Software Management Policy](https://rdm.vu.nl/public/policies-regulations/RDSM-policy-VU-EN-v3.0.pdf)
